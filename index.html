    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a software engineer who enjoys turning ideas into working applications.
      I started my career in Quality Assurance, where I learned the importance of precision,
      collaboration, and building reliable systems. Over time, I discovered my passion
      for coding and problem-solving, which led me to study Full Stack Software Development at Lambton College.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m comfortable working on both the frontend and backend and enjoy learning new tools
      that make development faster and cleaner. My goal is to grow as a developer while contributing to meaningful projects.
